# Kmeans
Run with python 3.8. Initalization options include random or furthest first, by changing the string parameter in main function (line 117). It is also possible to change the number of centres from this line, as the first parameter.

After clicking run, each time you click the red close button(x) on the window, an iteration passes. You can continue clicking it until the centres (big blue circles) stop moving, or until max iterations has been reached (10).
